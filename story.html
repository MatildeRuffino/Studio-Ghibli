            <br> <br> <br> Studio Ghibli, acclaimed Japanese animation film studio that was founded in 1985 by animators and directors Miyazaki Hayao and Takahata Isao and producer Suzuki Toshio. Studio Ghibli is known for the high quality of its filmmaking
            and its artistry. Its feature films won both critical and popular praise and influenced other animation studios. The headquarters are in Tokyo.
            <br> In 1984 Miyazaki made his second feature film, Kaze no tani no Naushika (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind), which was based on his own popular manga strip, and the following year Miyazaki, Takahata, and Suzuki established Studio Ghibli.
            The first official Studio Ghibli release was Tenkū no shiro Rapyuta (1986; Castle in the Sky). Most of the films produced by Studio Ghibli were written and directed by Miyazaki and include, in addition to the aforementioned, Tonari no Totoro
            (1988; My Neighbor Totoro), Majo no takkyūbin (1989; Kiki’s Delivery Service), and Kurenai no buta (1992; Porco Rosso). After Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was badly edited for release in the United States under the name Warriors of the
            Wind (1986), Miyazaki did not allow his films to be released in the West for many years. <br> In 1996, however, a deal was reached to allow Walt Disney Studios to distribute Studio Ghibli’s movies, with the caveat that no film editing was
            to take place. The following year Studio Ghibli issued Miyazaki’s blockbuster hit Mononoke-hime (Princess Mononoke).
            <br><br> <br>
            <div class="center"><img src="immagini-gif/foto sfondo 8.jpg" width="50%"></div>
            <br><br> <br> The story of Studio Ghibli, however, probably began more than thirty years ago, when Takahata and Miyazaki met for the first time: they both work at Toei Animation, a production studio that was only involved in animation films
            at the time. for cinema. For various reasons, the studio had then begun to produce only cartoons for TV (including the Heidi series, which aired in 1974, animated by Miyazaki and directed by Takahata).
            <br> Miyazaki and Takahata, dissatisfied with the limitations of the small screen, wanted to do something more: create an animation of the highest quality, which would explore the depth of the human mind and illustrate the joys and pains of
            life and emotions. When they realize that existing studios do not allow them to make this type of film, they realize they have no choice but to start their own studio.
            <br> At first, perhaps, none of the founders and staff really think that the firm will exist for long. “Let's make a movie. If it goes well, let's do another one. If it's a flop, then it ends there ... ”: this is the philosophy. Thus, to keep
            the risks to a minimum, we do not hire permanent staff, but about 70 temporary staff to carry out the project. At the end of the film, the team is disbanded. In this first phase, the office of the Studio, for rent, is located in a building
            in Kichijoji, on the outskirts of Tokyo. It is Takahata who implements the policies of the new Studio, it is he who produces Nausicaä della Valle del Vento and it is his ability as a business executive that makes a strong contribution to the
            start of Ghibli. Nausicaä was released in 1984 and brought nearly one million people to the cinema. The next Laputa arrives in the hall in 1986 and sells 775,000 tickets. Both films are well received by critics and audiences.

            <p>"Ghibli" is the name that, during the Second World War, the Italian pilots in North Africa gave to a hot desert wind coming from the Sahara Desert, and it is also the name used to indicate their reconnaissance airplanes. Hayao Miyazaki, who
                has always had a passion for old aircraft, was aware of it, and decided to use this word as a name for the new studio: "Let's blow a warm wind in the world of Japanese animation!".

            <h1>FOUNDERS</h1>
            <p> The two founders of the Ghibli studio, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, have created a product that enjoys enormous popularity both at home and abroad. It has gone on to win numerous awards and produce films that deviate a lot from classic
                Japanese anime. Miyazaki and Takahata met at Toei Animation, the major production house that still remains a giant in the animation industry; one designer and animator and the other director, worked together on many projects including
                "Lupine III", "Heidi" and "Anna with red hair". Unfortunately (or fortunately) with the passage of time they realized that using the television medium they would never be able to create works that embody their ideals; Miyazaki thus began
                to evaluate an alternative that many would define as a leap into the void: the foundation of a studio aimed at a revolutionary and high-quality animation that could transport the viewer into a world of emotions and colors. The turning
                point The definitive turning point came in 1984 with the creation of what is considered the starting point of the studio: “Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind”, written and directed by Miyazaki and produced by Takahata. The deep themes,
                the quality of the animations and the beauty of the drawings ensured the film an extraordinary success. Even today it is considered one of the best Japanese animated films in history, as well as the beginning of a revolutionary era for
                animation in Japan: it was 1985 and Studio Ghibli officially came to life. "Ghibli" (which in Japanese is read gibli) is the Lebanese term for the sirocco, the hot and dry wind of the Sahara desert. It was also used to refer to the Caproni
                Ca.309, an Italian Air Force aircraft used during the Second World War; it was Miyazaki who chose it as his name, thanks to the passion he has for the world of aviation.

                Hayao Miyazaki (宮 崎 駿 Miyazaki Hayao; Tokyo, January 5, 1941) is a Japanese director, screenwriter, animator, cartoonist, and film producer. With a fifty-year career, Miyazaki has over time become the exponent of Japanese animation best known abroad.
                His name is also intimately linked to that of Studio Ghibli, an animation film studio he founded in 1985 together with his colleague and mentor Isao Takahata and today considered one of the most important. of the sector. He is considered
                one of the most influential animators in the history of cinema and according to many the greatest living animation director: his figure has been compared several times to that of Walt Disney for the importance of his contributions in the
                animation sector and to Akira Kurosawa for his centrality in the history of Japanese cinema. According to many critics, Miyazaki is to be given credit, along with other colleagues of the caliber of the already cited Isao Takahata, Hideaki
                Anno, Katsuhiro Ōtomo, Satoshi Kon and Mamoru Oshii, as having helped to eliminate the stereotype of Japanese animation as an inferior or even valuable film and television reality artistic. His international fame grew after the victories
                of the Golden Bear and the Oscar for The Enchanted City, the first and so far only Japanese cartoon to win prizes. Some of his eleven feature films have held, or still hold, box office records at home: Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing
                film in Japan's history before the colossal Titanic, itself beaten three years later by The City enchanted, which remains the film that has grossed more in Japanese cinemas until 2020 when the Demon Slayer film surpassed it. As of 2014,
                four of his films (in addition to the two already mentioned, also Howl's Moving Castle and Ponyo on the cliff) are included in the ranking of the 10 highest grossing in history in Japan. His long career was awarded the Winsor McCay Award
                in 1998, the Golden Lion at the 2005 Venice Film Festival and the Oscar honorary conferred on him by the Academy in November 2014. In addition to the world of cinema and animation in general, Miyazaki is also appreciated for his comics
                production.

                Suzuki was born in Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture in 1948. In 1967 he enrolled at Keio University and graduated with a degree in literature in 1972. His professional career started at Tokuma Shoten, joining the company shortly after graduation. He was assigned
                to the planning department of Asahi Geino, entertainment, magazine, where he was responsible for the manga coverage page. Here he had a long anticipated meeting with cartoonist Shigeru Sugiura. In 1973 he became the editor of the magazine's
                supplement Comic & Comic (コミック&コミック, komiku & komiku), for which he worked with and befriended film directors, such as Sadao Nakajima, Eiichi Kudo and Teruo Ishii, as well as animators and manga artists, like Osamu Tezuka, George Akiyama,
                Kazuo Kamimura, Hōsei Hasegawa and Shotaro Ishinomori. During a hiatus of the comic supplement he was reassigned to the performing arts feature section of Asahi Geino, for which he covered such varied topics as Bōsōzoku, Japanese motorcycle
                gangs, and the bombing of the headquarters of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries by the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front. From this period he has mentioned Sayuri Ichijō [ja] as a memorable person. In 1975 Suzuki was assigned to the editorial
                department of the monthly Television Land. One of the series he worked on is Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace. In 1978 he became an editor for the, newly created, monthly magazine Animage, under its first editor-in-chief Hideo Ogata.

                In 1984 Nausicaä (Kaze no tani no Naushika) produced by Takahata and directed by Hayao Miyazaki achieved enormous success, but pushed the director to clash with the producers' requests for his next films. So in 1985, thanks to the help of Tokuma Shoten,
                Miyazaki and Takahata manage to realize their dream and found their own animation studio: Studio Ghibli. At this point, a relationship of complementarity is established between the two men: in 1987 Takahata produces Laputa - Castle in
                the sky (Tenkū no shiro Rapyuta) written and directed by Miyazaki and the following year Miyazaki produces Yanagawa horiwari monogatari ("The story of the canals di Yanagawa ") written and directed by Takahata, a documentary about the
                struggle waged by the local population to save the canal from overbuilding. In 1988 both Miyazaki and Takahata reach a very high peak of their production, with signs destined to last over time and to influence the collective imagination.
                In fact, Miyazaki directs My neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Totoro), whose profile will become the symbol of studio Ghibli, while Takahata directs the direction of A tomb for the fireflies, a sad story that features two children in the Kobe
                torn apart by the Second World War. . In 1991 Takahata made his second feature film by Ghibli: Rain of memories. In addition to the story of a young woman who finds herself at a crossroads in her life, the film deals with the contrast
                between different worlds such as the countryside and the city or childhood and adulthood; he analyzes these differences by juxtaposing flashbacks and present life to compose a person in his integrity, with the past reconciled with the
                present. Pom Poko (Heisei tanuki kassen ponpoko), awarded at the Annecy festival in 1994, deals with the relationship between nature and man, as seen by a group of Tanuki who risk losing their habitat due to the expansion of human settlements.
                Almost as an answer to the problem raised by Pom Poko, Hayao Miyazaki three years later directs Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime), in which he highlights the conflict between men and the gods of nature. Isao Takahata's interest focuses
                on the human being and animation is the privileged territory for studying the problems and dreams of contemporary man. In 1999, My Neighbors Yamada, Takahata in fact places the Yamada family at the center of the story, an average family
                seen in his daily life with lightness and humor. The technique of the film, however, changes radically, abandoning the traditional drawing on acetate and turning to computerized graphics, giving however the impression of a rough line,
                as if the characters had only been sketched on paper and filmed. In 2005 he began to deal with The Story of the Shining Princess, based on the ancient Japanese folk tale Taketori monogatari (lit. "The tale of a bamboo cutter"). The film
                was released in 2013, after 8 years of production. In 2015 Takahata was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French state. Communist sympathizer and pacifist, he is particularly committed to opposing nationalist Prime Minister
                Shinzo Abe and his plans to rearm Japan and participate in foreign operational theaters. In 2011, after the Fukushima disaster, he was critical of nuclear energy.
